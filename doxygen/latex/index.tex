Implementation of the image abstraction framework \mbox{\hyperlink{class_de_w_a_f_f}{De\+WAFF}} in C++. This framework allows to use WAF (Weighted Average \mbox{\hyperlink{class_filters}{Filters}}) with their input decoupled as a weigthing input and a processing input. The weighthing input is used to generate the kernel values for the WAFF and the processing input serves as input for the filter. This tehcnique is known as \char`\"{}deceiving\char`\"{}, hence the name of the framework. With this approach the filter\textquotesingle{}s kernel is weighted with the original input and as input it takes the original input filtered through an Un\+Sharp Mask (Laplacian deceive). Normal WAFs use the same image for both processes. This is the novelty of this framework, to avoid a pipelined approach by applying two different techniques to an image, but instead combine them and apply them as one.

The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_de_w_a_f_f}{De\+WAFF}} is aimed at improving patter recognition tasks providing the following improvements\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Noise reduction
\item Irrelevant detail simplification
\item Border emphasis of Regions Of Interest
\item Enhanced separation of ROIs from the background

The documentation for this project is hosted at \href{https://isaac-fs.github.io/DeWAFF/}{\texttt{ https\+://isaac-\/fs.\+github.\+io/\+De\+WAFF/}}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
This project requires that Open\+CV is alredy installed in your machine. For this you can follow the \href{https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html}{\texttt{ Open\+CV linux installation guide}}.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Clone the repository from \href{https://github.com/isaac-fs/DeWAFF}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/isaac-\/fs/\+De\+WAFF}}
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone https://github.com/isaac-\/fs/DeWAFF.git}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Build the project
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd ./DeWAFF}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake .}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build .}

\end{DoxyCode}
 After these steps binary named {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_de_w_a_f_f}{De\+WAFF}}} should appear in the directory. To recompile the project you can use the generated Makefille.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Execution}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
To execute the framework use the {\ttfamily ./\+De\+WAFF} command it can be as simple as to use 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./DeWAFF -\/i path/to/image}

\end{DoxyCode}
 But it supports a varied array of customization options, so a command can look like this 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./DeWAFF -\/i path/to/image -\/f dnlmf -\/p ws=31,ps=9,rs=15,ss=10}

\end{DoxyCode}


These are the instructions\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{usage: ./DeWAFF [-\/f <filter type>] [-\/p <filter parameters>]}
\DoxyCodeLine{        [-\/b <number of iterations>] [-\/h]}
\DoxyCodeLine{        -\/i <file name> | -\/v <file name>}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    DEFAULT PARAMETERS}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/ Filter:       dgf (Deceived Guided Filter)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/ Window size:  15}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/ Patch size:   7}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/ Range Sigma:  10}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/ Spatial Sigma:10}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/ USM Lambda:   2}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    PROGRAM OPTIONS}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/i, -\/-\/image: Process an image given a file name. The file name goes after the option. Example: '-\/i picture.png'}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/v, -\/-\/video: Process a video given a file name. The file name goes after the option. Example: '-\/v video.mp4'}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/f, -\/-\/filter: Choose which filter to use. The availabe options are:}
\DoxyCodeLine{        -\/ dbf:  deceived bilateral filter}
\DoxyCodeLine{        -\/ dsbf: deceived scaled bilateral filter}
\DoxyCodeLine{        -\/ dnlmf:deceived non local means filter}
\DoxyCodeLine{        -\/ dgf:  deceived guided filter}
\DoxyCodeLine{    For example, to process an image using the deceived bilateral filter use: './DeWAFF -\/i image.png -\/f dbf'}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/p, -\/-\/parameters: Change the filter parameters. The available parameters are:}
\DoxyCodeLine{        -\/ ws:    Window size}
\DoxyCodeLine{        -\/ rs:    Range Sigma}
\DoxyCodeLine{        -\/ ss:    Spatial Sigma}
\DoxyCodeLine{        -\/ lambda:Lambda value for the Laplacian deceive}
\DoxyCodeLine{        -\/ ps:    Patch size for the DNLM filter}
\DoxyCodeLine{    It is possible to change one or more parameters in the same line, for example '-\/p ws=15,rs=10,ss=10' would change the window size and the range and spatial sigma values for the filter. Using just '-\/p ws=15' would only change its window size The 'ps' option Only works with the filter set to 'dnlm'}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/b, -\/-\/benchmark: Run a series of N benchmarks for a video or an image. This option will run a series of N benchmarks and display the results in the terminal. Note: The results are NOT saved during this process. Indicate the number of iterations after the flag, for example '-\/b 10' would indicate to run the filter 10 separate times}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/h, -\/-\/help: Display the program's help message}

\end{DoxyCode}


The output wil be generated in the {\ttfamily /path/to/file} directory with the applied filter acronym as suffix {\ttfamily file\+\_\+\+ACRONYM.\+extension}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{Benchmark mode}\label{index_autotoc_md6}
There is also a benchmark mode that allows to run several executions over an image without saving it. This can be helpful to measure the performance of a particular De\+WAF for your needs.

To benchmark an image pass the image with the {\ttfamily -\/i} flag, but this time add the benchmark flag {\ttfamily -\/b} to indicate the number of benchmarking runs. The number of runs has to be a positive integer equal or greater than one 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./DeWAFF -\/i /path/to/image/file -\/b 10}

\end{DoxyCode}
 To benchmar a video just change the flag from {\ttfamily -\/i} to {\ttfamily -\/v} as follows 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./DeWAFF -\/v /path/to/video/file -\/b 3}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Take into consideration that videos take a long time to benchmark as each frame has to be processed
